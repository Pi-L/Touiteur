# Touiteur

## Description
*This "twitter like" app was a JavaScript exercise I worked on while learning web development at [CEFIM][8].*
I also learned to use Intersection Observers in order to make *[infinite scrolling][2]* possible, and to refresh only visible twits contents. 

**Date : 11/2019**

## Tools
- Vanilla JavaScript with [Intersection Observer API][1] and [Fetch API][3].
- CSS3
- [Gulp 4][5]
